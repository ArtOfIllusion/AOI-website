                <p class="card-text">I used skinning to create the body and fins. Basically I created several cross-sections of the fish with the splining tool, and then skinned across them with the skinning tool. Same for the fins. The spines of the fins are a bump-mapped texture. The scales are actually a displaced texture. I straightened the scales and spines using UV mapping. I also used layer parameters on the textures to vary colors and height of displacement. A few subtle touches include the debris in the water which is just some transparent planes with specks on them, and the variable light from above which is done with a translucent textured plane between the light and the scene. The plants were created with XFrog from which AOI easily imports models.</p>

                <p class="card-text">Inspired by M C Escher's 'Reptiles', this is meant to be an image of a painting 'spawning' frogs - while the artist disappears for a cup of coffee, the frogs come out and play! Too much here to go into depth about everything. The 'painting' itself I created from an AoI render of the frog (from the top with one ambient light to give a flat, simplistic image of the frog). This I then copied and pasted into the pattern in Paintshop Pro and made a texture from the resulting image and applied to a spline sheet. My favourite bits are the paintbox and jar on which I spent a reasonable amount of time rendering. The frog itself may look familar - it's a re-textured version of the blue poison arrow frog.</p>

                <p class="card-text">Once, after many attempts to create a flower bud, I finally stumbled upon a shape that seemed nice. The next logical step was a vase. This launched a series of flower-and-vase scenes of which the presented here picture is the most complex one. I believe that this variation is the sixth or so. Speaking in terms of AoI scenes, there have been ten (not counting the minor ones) separate scenes or so. After rendering they were united in a raster image processing application. The flower bud is not a hand-made mesh but a tricky displacement installation. I still wish I could lift the bridge higher up; it would look prettier that way. But I was not skillful enough to do so. Well, let it remind me of my own imperfection. ;-) A small puzzle for you all: can you find the tiny little wisp of grass (not the plant in the lower left-hand corner) in the full-sized picture? It is not at all conspicuous.</p>

                <p class="card-text">I used a script to create the hairs on the feather. I used a lot of lathing in this scene too. I also used Peter's thicken script to give volume to several of the objects. The pattern on the copper part of the lamp was done with a black and white image as the source for transparency. To get the grainy effect, I used a point light where the flame is and turned on soft shadows. Then I simply rendered with a low number for the antialiasing. I was going for a dark cherry finish on the desk.</p>

                <p class="card-text">I was playing around with the "Myst"-like island idea and came up with this scene. Then, after I completed an inital render, I realized that the whole thing was a sort of visual metaphor for the job I was about to quit. Just thought I'd mention that so you know there's some intense psychology behind this image :) The image textures are from a "free textures" site on the web (please ignore my lazy displacement maps). The seagulls were created using the Sculpt script, the ocean is a large cube, and the landscape started out as a spline mesh.</p>
